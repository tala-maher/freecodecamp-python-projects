# Lambda Expense Tracker ðŸ§¾âš¡

This is a simple command-line **Expense Tracker** built with Python, designed to showcase the power of **Lambda Functions**. It allows users to add expenses, filter them by category, and calculate totals â€” all while using concise lambda expressions for streamlined functionality.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Add expenses with amount and category.
- View all saved expenses.
- Filter expenses by category using `filter()` and lambda functions.
- Calculate total expenses using `map()` and `sum()` with lambda functions.
- Interactive menu via terminal.
